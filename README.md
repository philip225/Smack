Re-coded Smack application.
==========================

For Udemy course Kotlin for Android: Beginner to advanced.
----------------------------------------------------------

Section 7: Smack chat app.
--------------------------

This is a re-coded version of this application (section 7) that brings the application up to date 
with the latest changes for a Draw base application.
The UI parts of the course, especially the draw component part is out of date and is (to
the best of my knowledge) no achievable in its current form, anymore.

This version makes use of fragments and navigation, replacing the activities.

This will be added to as I progress through the course, with the completed steps
for section 7 being published in corresponding branches.
Note that some steps will be skipped over.

On completion, the final step will be merged back into master.

The code has detailed comments detailing the changes from the original course, amongst 
other things.
